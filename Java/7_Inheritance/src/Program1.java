/*1. A, B and C are classes
A is a super class. B is a sub class of A. C is a sub class of B. 
Create three methods in each class, 2 methods are specific to each class and third 
method (override method) should be in all three Classes A, B and C
Create a class with main method. Create an object for each class A, B and C in main 
method and call every method of each class using its own object/instance.
Call an overridden method with super class reference to B and C classâ€™s objects
Runtime Polymorphism with Data Members/Instance variables, Repeat the above 
process only for data members*/
